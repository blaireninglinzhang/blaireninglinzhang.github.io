		<h2>Hey what's up!</h2>
		<p>
			I'm a growing developer interested in tech and entrepreneurship, currently studying Computer Science at Duke University. I was born and raised in Shenzhen, China, a city that has now grown into the <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJ5cZnoodY" target="_blank" >Silicon Valley of China</a>. At the age of 13, however, I took a risk to move across the globe by myself and attend a private high school in Southborough, Massachusetts. My experiences have taught me to seek comfort in discomfort and build a strong sense of self. As an early and avid adopter of technologies, I'm fascinated by how they make their way into our daily lives. I love trying to explain complex concepts in very simple terms that even my 11-year-old brother can understand.

		<h2>What I've been up to</h2>
		<p>
			I spent this past summer busy falling in love with the Bay Area while working as a software engineering intern at a San Jose based startup called <a href="https://grokker.com/" target="_blank">Grokker</a>. 
		</p>
		-->

		<h2>What I do for fun</h2>
		<p>
			You can find me escaping the city lights to stargaze, getting lost in nature, reading poetry, or listening to a16z podcasts</a>. I'm also always looking for new places to travel to. You can check out my travel adventures <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pjFaFmV9X8CmZFk7GYpoNZMgMZb5UJGg&usp=sharing" target="_blank" >here</a>! 
		</p>

		<h2>What drives me</h2>
		<p>
			This quote embodies something that has been extremely instrumental for me in thinking about what I want to do with my life: 
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>&#8220;When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence itâ€¦ Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.&#8221;
			<cite>Steve Jobs</cite></p>
